# MIZU (IoT Satellite for Sustainable Agriculture) üõ∞Ô∏è
MIZU is project that was build during CLTP training in Japana in August, 2025.

## What is CLTP?
CLTP stands for the CanSat Leader Training Program. It is an intensive hands-on training program organized by UNISEC (University Space Engineering Consortium), Japan.

The program is designed to train trainers‚Äîmeaning participants not only learn how to design, build, test, and launch small educational satellites (CanSats), but also how to teach others to do the same in their own countries or institutions.

The 14th round of this training is coined as CLPT14 took place at Nihon University between 19 to 30 August 2025. This round of training was centred around the HEPTA-SAT training KIT  - a hands-on small satellite training kit developed by Professor Masahiko Yamazaki at Nihon University, in Japan.

## Training Method
This was a competnace based training with large percentage of time dedicated to the hands-on. The training was divided into three main parts. The first part involved  participants completing the six (6) practical labs in the first three days. The second part was project based learning where four teams were formed and each team developed a mission, desinged, implemented and tested/verified the satellite project. This included spending a full day sourcing the components for the mission from various shops in Tokyo. The last part was Teaching Practice where all participants were involved in training the students for two days.

## MIZU Satellite Mission

MIZU is a small IoT satellite mission that provides near‚Äëreal‚Äëtime weather data including the following:
- ambient temperature,
- humidity,
- soil temperature,
- soil moisture,
- wind sensor,

The data collected from these sensors is aggregated, analysed and could be used to improve the hydrolofical models  to predict the water levels and  microclimate data to support precision agriculture. The data could also be used in data‚Äëdriven irrigation and input management and therefore MIZU helps reduce water use, lower fertilizer runoff, and improve yields for smallholder farmers. 

MIZU responds to the Global Sustainable Development Goals, namely:
- Goal 2 ‚Äî Zero Hunger: increase agricultural productivity and resilience  
- Goal 6 ‚Äî Clean Water and Sanitation: optimize water use and reduce contamination  
- Goal 13 ‚Äî Climate Action: monitor weather and support adaptation  
- Goal 15 ‚Äî Life on Land: promote sustainable land management  
- Goal 17 ‚Äî Partnerships for the Goals: foster collaboration between farmers, researchers, and policymakers

The mission demonstrates how accessible small‚Äësatellite technology can empower local decision‚Äëmaking for sustainable agriculture.
